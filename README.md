## 📁 File Structure

- `netflix-analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations for the Netflix dataset analysis.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess Netflix data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize patterns in release years, content types, durations, genres, and countries.
- Answer questions like:
  - What type of content is more common on Netflix?
  - Which countries produce the most content?
  - How has content production changed over time?
